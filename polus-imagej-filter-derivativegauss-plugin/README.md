# ImageJ filter derivativeGauss

Performs the 2-D partial derivative Gaussian kernel convolutions on an image at a particular point.

This WIPP plugin was automatically generated by a utility that searches for
ImageJ plugins and generates code to run them. For more information on what this
plugin does, contact one of the authors: Nick Schaub (nick.schaub@nih.gov), 
Anjali Taneja or Benjamin Houghton (benjamin.houghton@axleinfo.com).
